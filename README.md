# Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application that allows users to send and receive messages instantly. The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface, while the backend is powered by Node.js, Express.js, and the Socket.IO library to enable real-time communication.

## Frontend Tech Stack

The frontend of the application is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML**: The standard markup language for creating the structure of the web pages.

- **CSS**: Used to style the HTML elements and create an appealing user interface.

- **JavaScript**: Provides interactivity to the application and handles real-time communication with the backend server through Socket.IO.

## Backend Tech Stack

The backend of the application is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. It serves as the backend server for this application.

- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust APIs and handling HTTP requests.

- **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server. It allows for instant messaging and event-based communication.

## How to Run the Application

To run this chat application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd chat-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the backend server using Node.js and Express.js, which will also initialize Socket.IO for real-time communication.

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the chat application.

## Usage

- Enter your desired username to join the chat room.
- Start sending and receiving messages in real-time with other users in the chat room.
